- take album art from foobar if possible
- some other glow or blur or whatever effect that will make sure that white text on a transparent background will be easily readable
- buttons fading in/out when mousehovered
- maybe create the effect of reflecting glass ;)
- extendable panels :)
- pixel accurate button hit testing
- prevent layers from drawing outside their clientRect, that could be probably done with Drawing.Clip or ClipRegion
- option to set actions for click/doubleclick/rightclick
- click through - could be made .... and buttons wouldn't be click through..
- vizualizace

- profile for speed 
- test stability

cool features:
    + now that the buttons will have an extended action specification, it could be used to enable/disable
      a layer which could in turn be used to create extendable panels

cleaning the code:
    - divide the Main class into several smaller classes for easier mantaince
		- one class that is the plugin itself - that receives events from foobar
		- that creates services such as menu commands
		- other classes for ..
    - clean up code of fooManagedWrapper (pref pages, CManagedWrapper)
		- and commenting to use doxygen probably

bugs:

    - BUG: Album art layer does not work for files played from zip

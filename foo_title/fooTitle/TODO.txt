- add optional persistent layer state (i.e. save 'enabled' state)
- some other glow or blur or whatever effect that will make sure that white text on a transparent background will be easily readable
- maybe create the effect of reflecting glass ;)
- pixel accurate button hit testing
- click through - could be made .... and buttons wouldn't be click through..

- profile for speed 
- test stability

cleaning the code:
    - divide the Main class into several smaller classes for easier mantaince
		- one class that is the plugin itself - that receives events from foobar
		- that creates services such as menu commands
		- other classes for ..
    - clean up code of fooManagedWrapper (pref pages, CManagedWrapper)
		- and commenting to use doxygen probably

bugs:
    - Preferences page has some text that is cut-off, when resolution scaling is above 100%.

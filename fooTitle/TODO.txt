+ add menu command to show up foo_title (which can be particulary useful when it's not always on top or it disappeared mysteriously)
+ implement saving of the value by implementing a custom version of cfg_var
+ add support for adding menu commands to foo_managedWrapper
+ test unicode in menu items = they don't work
+ when foo_title is disabled via the menu command, it doesn't show up in the prefpage
+ scriptable values
+ show only for a while (like pretty popup)
+ reset options button
+ fooManagedWrapper	
+ unify naming conventions
+ make Vista compatible
+ recompile with the new SDK
+ show on stream title change
+ read skins from user profile directory too

- add support for more actions for buttons, such as commands from the context menu, also the ability to specify which menu the command is in
- take album art from foobar if possible
- show on stop/pause
- some other glow or blur or whatever effect that will make sure that white text on a transparent background will be easily readable
- buttons fading in/out when mousehovered
- support rotated text (at least by 90 degrees)
- maybe create the effect of reflecting glass ;)
- extendable panels :)
- pixel accurate button hit testing
- prevent layers from drawing outside their clientRect, that could be probably done with Drawing.Clip or ClipRegion
- option to set actions for click/doubleclick/rightclick
- click through - could be made .... and buttons wouldn't be click through..
- vizualizace

- profile for speed 
- test stability

cool features:
    - now that the buttons will have an extended action specification, it could be used to enable/disable
      a layer which could in turn be used to create extendable panels

optimizations:
    - cache a smaller version of album art - resizing every frame a large album art is a huge CPU eater

cleaning the code:
    - divide the Main class into several smaller classes for easier mantaince
    - one class that is the plugin itself - that receives events from foobar
    - that creates services such as menu commands
    - other classes for ..


bugs:
    - BUG: Under the default settings, foo_title doesn't show upon foobar2000 start. (sometimes)
    + BUG: Under Vista, show only when foobar is minimized doesn't work (as they say).
    0 BUG: title formatting not evaluated on foobar start
        the problem is that when there's no song playing, titleformatting can't be evaluated. This won't be fixed, a better solution, probably involving C# scripting needs to be designed.
    - BUG: only show when minimized doesn't work
    + BUG: Only have one problem with it, everytime I start up foobar the titlebar doesn't showup until it plays through a song. Pretty much intially, when I have it minimized, it won't show anything until the first song I played from the time I started foobar is done playing. It's not that big a problem because I can just forward to the end of a song and let it show up, just a little annoying. Tryed looking through forms for answer and couldn't find anything, was wondering if I'm only one with the problem.
    + BUG: foo_title is preventing Windows from shutting down
    - BUG: some crashes http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=55428&hl=foo_title
    - BUG:
        Possible bug with latest version of foo_title:
        I'd recently begun using foo-title 0.7.0 with foobar v0.9.4.3 and when I selected "shutdown when noise stops" I noticed when I next swtiched on my PC (WinXP SP2 + .Net v.2) the History playlist had lost the recent entries played prior to shutting down. I tested it again and the same thing happened.
        I removed foo-title's components and re-ran the same playlist with "shutdown when noise stops" and the History playlist had been updated and remembered.
        Additionally foobar (which normally remembers it's last position in terms of last active playlist and minimised/maximised etc ..), re-opened in a different playlist and position - in this case maximised, when prior to shutting down it was minimised, with foo_title "always on top". So it seems info is being lost due to the foo-title component on shutting down (whilst open).
    + BUG: it may not be possible to drag it to some other monitor
    + BUG: closing the display window with Alt-F4 makes it crash
    + BUG: setting it to Normal (instead of always on top) and dragging right after that makes it freeze...completely
    + BUG: Toggle foo_title string is wrong in the View menu
    + BUG: fade length precise time display doesn't work
